Stand up API (/events/click, /telemetry, /health) with request logging, basic auth.


Define event schemas (correlation_id, sku_id, track_id, device_id, ts).


Add basic tests: idempotency (dedupe by correlation_id), retry/backoff, DLQ log.
 Week 1 deliverables


⚙️ API repo with CI, unit tests ≥70% on handlers


🧪 Idempotency test + DLQ log file


📜 Event schema doc (JSON examples)
 Week 2 responsibilities


Integrate detector + tracker (server or local module), emit bbox,class,track_id.


Wire MQTT (or WS mock) publish for retail/clicks and retail/actions.


Add metrics endpoints: p50/p90 click→ack latency, FPS, error rates.
 Week 2 deliverables


🤖 Minimal CV service producing track_id


📡 MQTT publish/subscribe demo working
