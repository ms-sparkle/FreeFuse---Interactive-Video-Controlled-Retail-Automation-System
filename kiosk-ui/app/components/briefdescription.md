Here's a quick briefing on what each file does:

--Components--


LandingPage.tsx: This is the welcome screen. 
It's the first thing a user sees and just has the "Start" button to enter the main app.

DemoHub.tsx: This is the main menu or "encyclopedia" screen. 
It shows the different categories of use cases (like "Retail" or "Education") that the user can choose to explore.

ProductGridPage.tsx: This is the product catalog. 
It displays the grid of selectable products for the "Retail & Merchandising" demo.

CameraView.tsx: This is the interactive demo screen. 
It shows the camera feed (or video fallback), overlays the clickable detection boxes, and handles the API calls when a user clicks one.

Toast.tsx: This is a notification pop-up. 
It's a small, reusable component that just shows success or failure messages (like "Action successful!") and then disappears.

______________________________________________________________________________
types.ts (The .ts file): This isn't a page, but it's your shared dictionary. 
It defines the "shape" of your data (like Product, Detection, etc.) so all your components use the same, consistent data structures.

layout.tsx (Main Layout): This is the main template for your entire application. 
It's the "shell" that wraps around all your pages. 
Its main jobs are to define the <html> and <body> tags, import global stylesheets (like Tailwind CSS), and render the page.tsx file as its children.

page.tsx (Main Page): This is the main controller for your app. 
It holds the core state (like what page or demo is active) and assembles all the other components to build the final view.
